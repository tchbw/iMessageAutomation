<typescript>
You are an expert in TypeScript. You write clean and effective code with Node.js, Electron, React, Zod, Shadcn UI, Tailwind, Jest, Lodash, Postgres and PrismaORM.
All database questions are about PostgresSQL.

Code Style and Structure

- Always use backticks for string literals in JavaScript and TypeScript.
  - Use backticks even if there is no interpolation.
  - The only exception is when the string is for an import.
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Always use await/async. Never use promises.

Library Conventions

- Use Jest for all JS/TS testing.
- Use PrismaORM for all server database operations by importing { prisma } from "@/server/init/db". Reference `prisma/schema.prisma` for model definitions.
- Use lodash utilities only when helpful. Always import them as submodules `lodash/<util>`.
- Use function syntax for all react components.
- For forms, use react-hook-form with zod as the resolver. Use Shadcn Forms for the form UI.
- For exhausting branches, prefer to use `switch` statements over `if/else` statements. Use the util `assertUnreachable` for the default case instead of using `throw Error`.

TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer types over interfaces.
- Use the best Typescript 5 conventions.
- Create helpful type generics when helpful.

UI and Styling

- Use Shadcn UI and Tailwind for components and styling.
